# uAir

The uAir project represents an ambitious community-driven initiative aimed at enhancing environmental awareness through technology. Initiated in 2021, this project harnesses the collaborative efforts of dedicated volunteers, leveraging their expertise in hardware and software development. At its core, uAir is designed as a compact, low-cost IoT device, remarkable for its self-sufficiency and minimal maintenance requirements. These devices are equipped with a suite of sensors to measure vital outdoor environmental parameters such as air quality, noise levels, and temperature. When deployed collectively, they hold the potential to create comprehensive and detailed heatmaps, offering invaluable insights into the environmental health of urban areas.

This GitHub repository serves as a comprehensive archive of the project's journey, encompassing both the prototype development phase and the research that underpinned it. The artifacts contained herein, ranging from design documentation to software code and hardware schematics, are a testament to the team's commitment to open-source and community engagement. The goal was to democratize access to high-resolution environmental data, empowering citizens to actively participate in monitoring and improving the quality of life in their cities. While the project is currently undergoing a phase of reassessment and development has been paused, the repository remains a rich resource for anyone interested in IoT development, environmental monitoring, or community-driven technological initiatives.
